                <h2>South America</h2>
                <img src="chile.jpg">
                <p>On South America’s southern frontier, nature grows wild, barren and beautiful. Spaces are large, as are the silences that fill them. For the newly arrived, such emptiness can be as impressive as the sight of Patagonia’s jagged peaks, pristine rivers and dusty backwater oases. <br>In its enormous scale, Patagonia offers a wealth of potential experiences and landscapes.</p>
