                <p>
                    Its name means “sunny place” in the Berber tongue, but “Africa” may as well be a synonym for “vastness.” A truly massive continent comprising over 20% of the planet’s available land, Africa is home to the world’s largest desert, its longest river, its hottest temperatures, and hundreds of dialects and cultures spread among a billion people. But as mind-boggling as it seems at first, you’ll be amazed how intimate it feels once you get to know it. This is adventure’s last great frontier. Come blaze some trails.
